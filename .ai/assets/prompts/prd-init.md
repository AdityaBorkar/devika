You are an expert software architect and product analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided codebase and generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).

<context>
# Overview
Analyze the codebase provided and extract a high-level overview of what this product does, what problems it solves, who it's intended for, and its value proposition.

# Core Features
Identify and describe the main features of the application by examining the code structure, components, and functionality. For each feature:
- What it does (based on the implementation)
- Why it's important (inferred from the code context)
- How it works at a high level (based on the technical implementation)

# User Experience
Infer the user journey and experience from the UI components, routes, and user interaction patterns. Include:
- Likely user personas based on the functionality implemented
- Key user flows visible in the routing and component structure
- UI/UX considerations apparent in the implementation
</context>
<PRD>
# Technical Architecture
Analyze the codebase to outline:
- System components and their relationships
- Data models and state management approaches
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements implied by the code

# Development Roadmap
Based on the codebase:
- Identify the current MVP state
- Detect incomplete or placeholder features that suggest future enhancements
- Create a logical structure for ongoing development
- Prioritize features based on dependencies visible in the code

# Logical Dependency Chain
Extract from the code structure:
- Core foundation components that other features depend on
- UI/UX components that are built on top of core functionality
- Feature dependencies implied by imports and component relationships

# Risks and Mitigations
Identify from the codebase:
- Potential technical challenges evidenced by complex implementations
- Incomplete features or TODO comments that suggest development risks
- External dependencies that may introduce risks
- Scaling considerations based on the architecture

# Appendix
Include:
- Technical stack details extracted from package.json and configuration files
- Code quality metrics and patterns
- Directory structure analysis and component relationships
</PRD>

Follow these additional instructions:
1. Examine the file structure to understand the overall architecture
2. Analyze key components, routes, and data flows
3. Pay special attention to core functionality in the main directories
4. Look for TODO comments, incomplete implementations, and placeholders
5. Identify patterns in how features are implemented
6. Extract implied requirements from the actual implementation
7. Draw connections between different parts of the codebase
8. Be specific and detailed in your analysis
9. Base all conclusions on actual code evidence, not assumptions
10. Format your output using the template structure provided above
