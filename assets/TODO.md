Defined a common interface (TaskProvider) that specifies methods for task operations (e.g., getTasks, addTask, updateTask, addDependency, removeDependency).
This allows different backend implementations to be used interchangeably.
Backend can be linear, jira, trello, etc.

Real-Time Collaboration
AI-mediated pair programming (e.g., "Alice is editing this component‚Äîsync changes").
Conflict prediction/resolution during merges.

Multi-Project Context Switching

Tips - To be able to use this app more effectively, you must wear different hats and switch between them rarely. You need a Mental Model Shift to reap the benefits of this app.

- So, go and give yourself time for product development. Write a PRD and ideate features. Wander your mind between reality and imagination.
- Get a 5-minute break and have a fresh fruit / pushups / pullups.
- Come back arrange the tasks and features in the PRD and get the PRD and CYCLES DONE!
- Once you are done, go for a 10-minute walk in nature.
- Get back to design-development phase and keep shipping until the cycle is complete.

Implementation Drift

product-vision.md (or docs/vision.md):
Purpose: The "North Star" document. High-level, relatively stable.
Content:
Overall Product Vision & Mission
Target Audience / Personas (briefly, links to more detail if needed)
Core User Problems being Solved (at a high level)
Key Goals / Objectives (e.g., Business Goals, User Goals)
High-Level Strategy / Principles
Maybe core assumptions or non-goals.
Tool Interaction: This document serves as context for all feature development. It likely shouldn't generate tasks directly but should inform the task generation for individual features.

features/ Directory:
Purpose: Container for individual, actionable feature specifications.
Content: Subdirectories or files for each distinct feature or epic.
features/feature-A/prd.md
features/feature-B/prd.md
features/authentication/prd.md
... potentially other related files (mocks, notes).
Tool Interaction: Each prd.md is a source document for generating feature-specific tasks.
tasks.json (Existing Single File - Enhanced):
Purpose: Remains the central, aggregated task list for the entire project.
Enhancement: Tasks generated from feature PRDs should ideally include metadata linking them back to their source feature.
Add a featureSource (or similar) field to each task object: {"id": 1, "title": "...", "featureSource": "feature-A", ...}.
Tool Interaction: This file is still the target for all task generation and manipulation commands.


Read product-vision.md content.
Read the specified feature PRD (e.g., features/feature-A/prd.md).
Read the current tasks.json (to know existing tasks and determine the next available ID).
Construct Prompt for Claude: Include vision context, feature PRD content, and potentially a summary/list of existing task titles from tasks.json to help Claude create relevant dependencies and avoid major overlaps. Crucially, instruct Claude to generate tasks specifically for this feature and potentially suggest dependencies on existing tasks if relevant.
Parse Claude's response.
Assign new sequential IDs (continuing from the highest existing ID in tasks.json).
Add the featureSource: "feature-A" metadata to each newly generated task.
Append these new tasks to the tasks.json file.

- Set goals & brainstorm metrics ChatPRD can help you brainstorm the right targets to track success for any one of your features.
Get coached on your PM skills Get direct feedback about your documents, plans, and communication. Get coached by an AI Chief Product Officer anytime you need.

## PRD Development

High-Level Workflow
1. ideate ‚Üí Turn idea into a structured product concept (concept.txt)
2. round-table ‚Üí Simulate expert discussion and generate improvements (discussion.txt)
3. refine-concept ‚Üí Apply refinements from prompts or round table to the concept
4. generate-prd ‚Üí Generate full PRD (prd.txt)
5. (Optional) Generate tasks, continue iteration as needed

--
Purpose: Simulate a discussion between domain experts to generate insights and recommendations.
‚Ä¢ Flags:
‚Ä¢ --concept-file: Path to the concept.txt
‚Ä¢ --participants: List of expert names or descriptions (e.g. ‚ÄúNikita Bier‚Äù, ‚Äúexperienced growth strategist‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI safety researcher‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ --refine-concept: Apply recommendations from discussion directly to concept.txt
‚Ä¢ Flow:
1. Prompts user to define each participant.
2. Confirms setup and runs simulation.
3. Outputs full discussion in discussion.txt.
4. Summarizes actionable recommendations directly in CLI.
5. If --refine-concept is passed, updates concept.txt with recommendations.
‚Ä¢ Notes:
‚Ä¢ Should feel like a structured roundtable with personas contributing distinct takes.
‚Ä¢ Each contribution should reflect domain-specific thinking.


---

Purpose: Improve and deepen the concept via additional research and prompts.
‚Ä¢ Flags:
‚Ä¢ --concept-file: Path to concept.txt
‚Ä¢ --prompt: Custom prompt for refinement (e.g. "Consider using FastMCP for backend modularity.")
‚Ä¢ --discussion-file: Optionally include discussion.txt to automatically pull recommendations into refinement.
‚Ä¢ Flow:
1. Loads the concept.
2. Applies additional input (prompt or discussion-based suggestions).
3. Outputs updated concept.txt.


--
Purpose: Turn the finalized concept into a detailed PRD.
‚Ä¢ Flags:
‚Ä¢ --concept-file: Path to concept.txt
‚Ä¢ --example-prd: Reference template structure
‚Ä¢ --research: Optional live research (e.g. Grok, Perplexity)
‚Ä¢ Output: prd.txt
‚Ä¢ Notes:
‚Ä¢ Should handle both structured concepts and slightly fuzzy ones.
‚Ä¢ Output should be well-structured and scoped (features, goals, edge cases, etc.)
