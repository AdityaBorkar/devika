## Issues to solve

- Context Management
- Revising and asking for input to refine the 
- Staring new threads when required
- Assistants with specific roles - Testing, Documentation, Code Review, Release & Deployment, Security Vulnerabilities Scanner
- Language-Specific Optimization Techniques
- Dividing larger codebases into smaller understandable tokens to understand what is happening and making calls accordingly

- Use a database and MCP instead of a file-storage to increase performance.

## Prompts:

Generate a PRD
Write PRD using a sample template (you can also write to Google Docs to share with others)
Generate tasks from PRD
Update Tasks from PRD (analyze for changes using git)
Analyze Complexity
Breakdown complex tasks into smaller tasks

Ollama support (tasks generated by Claude and Perplexity right now)

Two way task/PRD sync
Generate test file for any task file to easily verify functionality and improve code stability as Cursor implements other tasks
Bulk verify implementation and mark all related tasks as done ‚Äî makes it easier to drop this into an existing project

Tool Access Restrictions: Adjust the "groups" field for each mode to control which tools they can use (e.g., read, edit, browser, command, mcp).

Role Definitions & Custom Instructions: Edit the roleDefinition and customInstructions to match your organization‚Äôs language and standards. For lengthy instructions, consider using .clinerules-{mode-slug} files.

API Configuration (Optional): Add an "apiConfiguration" property to any mode for model-specific parameters (e.g., {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.2}).

Approval Settings: Configure manual or auto-approvals for new_task and attempt_completion actions in your Roo Code workflow settings.

Project-Specific Overrides: Store this JSON in .roomodes at your project root to override global settings from cline_custom_modes.json.
