## Issues to solve

- Context Management
- Revising and asking for input to refine the 
- Staring new threads when required
- Assistants with specific roles - Testing, Documentation, Code Review, Release & Deployment, Security Vulnerabilities Scanner
- Language-Specific Optimization Techniques
- Dividing larger codebases into smaller understandable tokens to understand what is happening and making calls accordingly

- Use a database and MCP instead of a file-storage to increase performance.

## Prompts:

Generate a PRD
Write PRD using a sample template (you can also write to Google Docs to share with others)
Generate tasks from PRD
Update Tasks from PRD (analyze for changes using git)
Analyze Complexity
Breakdown complex tasks into smaller tasks

Ollama support (tasks generated by Claude and Perplexity right now)

Two way task/PRD sync
Generate test file for any task file to easily verify functionality and improve code stability as Cursor implements other tasks
Bulk verify implementation and mark all related tasks as done â€” makes it easier to drop this into an existing project

## Collected TODOs from codebase

### Layout & Architecture
- Entire thing is a SPA in Bun with React Router + Server-Sent-Events + Websockets. (src/app/layout.tsx)

### Configuration & Data Management
- Throw Validation Errors (src/algorithm/config.ts)
- If not exists create file (src/algorithm/config.ts)
- Sync stores using websockets / SSE. (src/hooks/useConfig.tsx)

### Onboarding & Authentication
- Add submit logic (src/app/(app-onboarding)/onboarding/page.tsx)

### UI Components & Pages
- Make this external link to https://cursor.directory/ (src/app/(app)/ai-editor/layout.tsx)
- Add dashboard widgets (src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx)
- Implement cycle list view and management (src/app/(app)/cycles/page.tsx)
- Implement repository scanning and display (src/app/(app)/repository/page.tsx)

### Repository Styling Page
- Fetch actual style configs from backend (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)
- Implement actual TipTap editor component (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)
- Replace with actual state management/fetching logic (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)
- Persist new config to backend (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)
- Delete config from backend (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)
- Add editor/controls for Common Style Config (src/app/(app)/repository/styling/page.tsx)

### Next.js and UI Improvements
- Ensure all components follow React Server Component patterns where appropriate
- Convert UI components to use shadcn/ui equivalents
- Follow mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive design
- Optimize for Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Limit use of 'use client' directive to components that actually need client-side interactivity
- Implement dynamic loading for non-critical components

### Task Management Components
- Update task status types in components/tasks/types.ts
- Ensure consistency in task status naming and filtering across components
- Implement proper state management for task filtering and updates
